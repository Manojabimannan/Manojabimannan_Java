Interface:
   1.It is used to achieve abstraction.
   2.By interface, we can support the functionality of multiple inheritance.
   3.It can be used to achieve loose coupling.
   4.Interface are used to implement abstraction.
   
 Diff b/w class and interface:
      class                                      Interface
 1. you can instantiate variable               1.In an interface,you can't instantiate variable
 and create an object.                           and create an object.
 2.A class can contain concrete                2.The interface cannot contain concrete
 (with impl) methods                             (with impl) methods.
 3.The access specifier used with cls          3.Interface only one specifier is used public.
 are private,protected,public.
 
 Maker Interface:
 -> An interface is recognized as an empty interface(no field, or methods) is maker interface.
 Example MI: Serializable,Cloneable,and Remote interface.
 
      Abstract Class                                   Interface Class
1.Both abstract and non-abstract methods          1.The interface contain only abstract methods.
may be found in an abstract class.
2.Abstract class support Final method.            2.The interface class does-not support final methods.
3.Multiple Inheritance is not supported by        3.Multiple Inheritance is supported by
the abstract class.                                 the Interface class.
4.Abstract keyword is used to declare             4.Interface keyword is used to declare 
  abstract class.                                    interface class.
 5.Extend keyword is used to extend               5.implement keyword is used to implement.
 6.Abstract class like protected,private.         6.All class members are public by default.
