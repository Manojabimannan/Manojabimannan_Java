Constructor:
 -> Initialize the state of the object.
 -> Name of the constructor must be similar to class name.
 -> it doesn't have a explicit return type.
 
 Types of Constructor:
 
 1.Default Constructor: 
   -> which does not accept any value.
   -> initialize the instance variable with default values.
   -> When there is no creating constructor for class it automatically compiler provide default constructor.
 
 2.Parameterized Constructor:
   ->One which can initialize the instance variables with given values.
   ->constructor which accepts the arguments is called parameterized constructor.
   
 -> The constructor is not inherited.
 -> The constructor can't be final.
 
 Can we overload the constructor:
-> yes we can overloaded b y changing the number of arguments accepted by the constructor or changing the datatype 
   of parameters.
  
 Copy constructor:
 -> There is no copy constructor in java. we can copy the values from one object to another like copy constructor in c++.
    ways to copy the values of one object into another in java:
    1.By constructor
    2.By assigning the value of one object into another.
    3.By clone() method of object class.
    
    
  Java constructor                                       Java Method
  1.Initialize the state of object                      1.Expose the behavior of an object.
  2.It must not have return type                        2.It have return type
  3.Invoked implicitly                                  3.Invoked Explicitly
  4.It provide default constructor if you               4.Method is not provided by the compiler in any case
  don't have any constructor in class.
  5.constructor name is same as cls name                5.Method name may or may not same as class name.
