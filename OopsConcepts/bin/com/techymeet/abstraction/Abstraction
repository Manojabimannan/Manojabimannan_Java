Abstraction:
  ->It is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to user.
  ->It displays just the essential things to user and hides the internal implementation
  Example: sending sms where you type the text and send message.You don't know the internal processing about the message delivery.
  Abstraction enables you to focus on what the object does instead of how it does it. 
  Abstraction lets you focus on what the object does instead of how it does it.
  
   2 ways to achieve abstraction
   1.abstract class
   2.Interface
   
  Abstract class:
 -> A class which is declared as abstract is known as an abstract class. 
 -> It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
 -> It needs to be extended and its method implemented. It cannot be instantiated.
 
 Rule:
 1.An abstract class must be declared with abstarct keyword
 2.It can have abstract and non-abstract methods
 3.it cannot instantiated
 4.it can have constructor and static method also.
 5.It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change body of method.
 
 Abstract method:
 A method which is declared as abstract and does not have implementation is known as an abstract method.
 
 Note:
  If there is an abstract method in a class, that class must be abstract.
