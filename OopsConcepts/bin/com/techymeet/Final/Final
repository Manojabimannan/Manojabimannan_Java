Final variable:
-> The final variable is used to restrict the user from updating.if we initialize the final variable,we
can't change its value.
-> The final variable which is not assigned to any value can only assigned through class constructor.

Can we initialize the final blank variable?
-> yes , if it not static , we can initialize in constructor , if it is static blank variable it can initialized only in 
static block.

yes we can declare main method as final. 

Final can  never be a constructor it can't be inherited.


The main difference between the final method and abstract method is that the 
abstract method cannot be final as we need to override them in the subclass to give its definition.
