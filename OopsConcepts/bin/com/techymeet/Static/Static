Static variable:
-> It is used to refer to common property of all objects. 
-> Static variable gets memory only once in the class area at time of class loading.
-> Using static variable makes your program more memory efficient.
-> Static variable belongs to class rather than object.  

Static Method:
-> It belong to class rather than the object.
-> There is no need to create the object to call static method.
-> It access and change the value static variable.

Restrictions applied Java static method:
-> The static method can not use non-static data member or call non-static method directly.
-> this and super cannot be used in static context as they are non-static.

Main Method:
-> Because object is not required to call the static method.
-> if we make main method non-static ,JVM will have to create its object first and then call main() method 
which will lead to extra memory allocation.

can Override static method:
-> No , we can't override the static method.

what is static block ?
It is used to initialize the static data member .It is executed before the main method at the time of class loading.

static modifier is removed from signature of main method?

Static Method                                           Instance Method
1.Method that declare as static is                      Method that is not declared static is
  static method.                                        known as instance method.
2.don't create the object to call static ram 
compiles,at runtime,it throws an error "NoSuchMethodError".  method object is required to call the instance method
3.Non-static(instance) members cannot access in         Static and non-Static variables both can be accessed
  static-context(static method,static nested class)     in instance methods.
  directly.  

can we make constructor in static?
As we know that static-context(method,block,variable) belong to class, not the object where as constructor is
belong to object so there is no make constructor as static . If you try it show compile error.

Can we make abstract method static  in java?
 if we make abstract method static , it will become the part of the class and we can directly call it which is unnecessary.
 
 can we declare the static variable and methods in abstract class?
 Yes, we can declare the static variable and methods in abstract class and we can access the static context declare inside
 the abstract class by using name of abstract class.
